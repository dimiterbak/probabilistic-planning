# PROBABALISTIC PLANNING

Agile teams commonly apply 'yesterday's weather' to forecast delivery dates and required resources. Unfortunately, the overall success of this approach is mediocre, at best. Can we do better? Yes, we can!

In this hands-on workshop you will learn practical probabilistic forecasting techniques applied to any flavour of Agile software development. Probabilistic forecasting uses historical data from the actual delivery history of a team and combines it with probabilistic techniques & Monte Carlo simulations to greatly enhance the reliability of your team's forecasts.

All techniques are explained by solving real-world problems using hands-on exercises. You will learn how to use concrete tools and knowledge that allow software and IT projects to be rapidly forecasted using historical data when available.

You will learn:
- The goals of forecasting, how probabilistic forecasting works and why you need it
- What data should be captured and how it can be used
- Forecasting using story points or number of user stories
- How to answer the three biggest forecasting questions:
  - How Big — determining how big is the feature or project with less effort
  - How Long — determining how long it would take to deliver a project or feature
  - How Much — determining what will fit into a fixed delivery time (e.g. sprint, release, quarter)
  - How to use Continuous forecasting to see as early as possible if the reality is going in the same direction as our forecast.

Probabilistic planning will benefit people in the following roles:
- Product Managers
- Product Owners
- Scrum masters
- Agile coaches
Anyone who currently uses estimates to forecast how long it will take or how big teams need to be to deliver work irrespective of the process used such as Scrum, Kanban, SAFe or combinations.

No specific statistical or mathematical knowledge is needed. This workshop introduces all of the skills needed to perform forecasts without complex statistics or mathematics. Bring a laptop, that has Excel installed, to follow along, or just watch me or your colleagues.
